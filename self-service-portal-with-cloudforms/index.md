# Lab Overview

## Building a self-service portal with Red Hat CloudForms

User self-service is seen as one of the defining capabilities of cloud computing. Red Hat CloudForms provides a self-service portal and catalog to deploy IT services over a variety of virtualization and cloud providers.

In this lab, you will get an introduction to CloudForms self-service, followed by hands-on examples. You will start by creating a service catalog item to deploy a virtual machine and then move on to more advanced topics, like orchestration templates (OpenStack HEAT) as services. To be ready to use these features in real-world scenarios, you will learn how to limit catalog visibility and access with CloudForms' role-based access control feature.
